# Dexign the Future Project 2

Three Generation Personas  
Dan Tasse

## What world do they live in?

The [Shell Mountains scenario](http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios/new-lens-scenarios.html). An extension of the current status quo. Those with power tend to slowly gain more power, and authority becomes more concentrated in a few cities. Government creates more broad mandates than they did in the early 2000s. Social mobility is stifled, though the US government tries to create the illusion that society is more mobile than it is. Central planning leads the world to slowly transition to natural gas, then to renewable resources, before climate change gets too radically out of hand.

## The Family

(work in progress)

- **Manuel** (b. 1988) - calm and centered. Professional marketer, but never loved business. Somewhat conservative in that he doesn't mind the status quo. It's working all right for him. Met Erica via OkCupid. Always wanted to have kids, but as they didn't think they could, they adopted Gautam. Took five years off work when they moved to Cleveland to raise Gautam, Amelia, and Calvin. Later worked part time as a marketing consultant for small businesses in Cleveland. He still doesn't love it, but he likes being his own boss, and he's developed useful skills.
- **Erica** (b. 1990) - successful and idealistic. Direct focus on career led her to be promoted to COO at a small and growing technology company; became pregnant with Amelia soon after they adopted Gautam. The "Tech 2.0 Bubble" bursting put them out of business, though, so they had to move from incredibly expensive San Francisco to Cleveland. Primary breadwinner for the family, especially after Manuel took time off to raise the family.
- **Gautam** (b. 2015, adopted by Manuel and Erica 2018) - from a rural north Indian village. Active, enjoyed sports, a natural leader. Studied business like Manuel, but had trouble finding a job after college, so he took a part time job as a portable nuclear technician. The company never hired him full-time, so he's been struggling to make it by.
- **Carrie** (b. 2018) - workers' rights activist. Grew up seeing workers mistreated at companies like Uber and Amazon, so organized campaigns for higher minimum wages. Unfortunately, she had to work multiple jobs to make it by, and has always had trouble making ends meet as well. She and Gautam feel like they finally have a stable enough situation to start having kids, but they often feel the strain of their finances.
- **Francesca** (b. 2049) - first child of Gautam and Carrie. Gets along well with her child care group as well as her robot caretaker. Speaks English and Chinese, thanks to the robot. Her parents have high hopes for her, because they feel like they fell out of the middle class and she can climb back to it.
- Emilia (b. 2054) - second child of Gautam and Carrie. Is a baby.
- **Calvin** (b. 2021) - second biological child of Manuel and Erica. The youngest in the family, he's always been a bit shy, but he channeled his energy into his music, becoming a skilled guitarist. He knew since an early age, though, that there'd be no money in that, so he's acquired a wide array of music-related jobs in the meantime. Uses a vintage Macbook to create techno-inspired loops to mimic early 2000s music to DJ in a dance club, teaches musical-mental augmentation to rich kids, performs occasionally as an acoustic guitarist inspired by very technical metal. Had a bout of addiction to designer uppers during his more intense DJing days, but has been clean since. Still, his life has been too busy to "settle down"; he's not sure if he ever will, and he's comfortable with that.
- Amelia (b. 2019), Ray (b. 2018), Colin (b. 2022), Andrew (b. 2046), Graham (b. 2048). Amelia is the first biological child of Manuel and Erica. Ray and Colin are both members of her poly family, and they have two children, Andrew and Graham. Won't talk more about these in this project, because we have to focus somewhere.
