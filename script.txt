- (Grandparents driving car in. There's no street parking.)

- Manuel: oh right, no street parking. Where do we park?
Erica: Gautam said this lot.
Manuel: are you sure? Looks sketchy.

- (open door) Manuel and Erica: Happy birthday, Francesca!
Gautam: Hi Mom and Dad! She's over with the robot.

- (Francesca looks up from robot, who has a very plain, robotic face) Francesca: huh? oh! Ni hao! Hi, grandma and grandpa!

- (in kitchen) Erica: you're still letting her play with that robot?
Carrie: Yes, of course! She's learning Chinese too.
Erica: But what about real kids?
Carrie: Well, she's got play dates set up with them. And it's not like she can just run around outside. Not in this neighborhood.

- Carrie: Besides, she can use it to play with kids remotely too.
Erica: I don't know, it seems awfully impersonal. Won't it hurt her social development?
Carrie: Mom, what can we do? Next thing, you'll be telling me not to use SedateFormula too.
Erica: Well, we never did.

- Erica: But that's beside the point. I brought a cake, too.
Carrie: Aw, mom!
Erica: But it's her birthday!
Carrie: Well, I suppose once a year...

- Manuel: And now for the presents...
(Francesca opens it)

- (it's a spaceship thing, says "Europa Lander")
Francesca: Oh.

- Manuel: What's wrong?
Francesca: Well, I could just print it.

- Gautam: Franny! That's not nice. Say thank you.
Francesca: Ok, thanks Grandma and Grandpa.

- Carrie: Hey, Uncle Calvin's calling!
Francesca: Uncle Calvin!

- (Calvin's face appears on the robot)
Francesca: Hi, uncle Calvin!
Calvin: Hi Franny!

- Calvin: Hey, I've got a song I wrote for you. You've got a Robohelper 5, right?
Gautam: Yeah
Calvin: Should work, hand him the guitar.

- (nothing happens)

- Calvin: Oh well. Sorry about that. Dang, nothing ever works. Well, I'll cloud you a recording, you can listen to it whenever you want.
Francesca: Thanks!

- Manuel and Erica: Well, we've got to go.
